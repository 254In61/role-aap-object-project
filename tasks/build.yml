# Why scm_delete_on_update: true
# If there's a logs/*.log file being updated on real-time vs what's on git repo, git conflicts will happen.
# When project source control synch job fails EVERYTHING else i.e subsequent job templates will fail..ghhhhrrrr

# Easiest trick is to delete the repo localy and clone again.
# This will introduce this task in the job 'source control synch'
